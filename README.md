**Here is our: [Project Proposal Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1y1cIMZUi84rIxTYbBRZkv12nnpZyd2N2_cxEGesJl_4/edit#slide=id.p).**

## 1. App Concept

Our app delivers daily or weekly creative prompts to our users. Users can choose a topic of their interest - such as drawing, photography, engineering, coding, painting, or music. For their selected interest or creative hobby, the app will prompt them with a custom challenge - for example, “draw a castle only using circles” or “paint a park nearby.” Users can upload photos or text of their creations to their community, and other users can provide feedback to them using for example comments or awards. There can also be judging challenges or voting competitions where people vote for the best creative creation. Winners can expect to receive virtual trophies or badges that they can display on their profile.

## 2. App Purpose

Our app encourages people to invest time into a daily or weekly creative activity, and help build a community around their hobbies or passions. Daily or weekly practice over time helps them develop their skills, and our app also allows them to connect with like minded people and get inspired by one another to further develop their craft. It is a fun way to work on something that you enjoy with other people - it’s like a virtual drawing community or photography community - everyone can help one another get better at something they enjoy.

## 3. Selected Sensor

We will leverage the camera sensor on our mobile devices to allow users to take photos of their creative creations. This is most helpful for categories like drawing, photography, and painting.

## 4. Selected API

We plan to use either Imgur API or ImageKit API to handle easy image upload and sharing. If image upload to a database is quick without an API, we can also use OpenAI API or a free API to create new random creative prompts for users.

## 5. Selected DB

(firebase firestore for images…?)

## 6. Target Devices

(2 target device types for testing)

## 7. Initial Wireframes / Sketches

(Add sketches or wireframes here)
